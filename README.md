## Software Engineer — Full-Stack, Architecture & Developer Experience
Antoine Mahassadi,
I’m a Software Engineer focused on designing reliable, readable, and scalable systems.  
I work across the entire software lifecycle — architecture, implementation, automation, code quality, and developer experience.

My engineering approach is based on key principles:  
- **Software architecture**: modularity, clear boundaries, domain-driven thinking  
- **Code quality**: strong typing, intention-driven design, consistent patterns  
- **Automation & tooling**: CI/CD pipelines, GitHub Actions, workflow optimization  
- **Backend logic & APIs**: domain modeling, clean data flows  
- **Developer Experience (DX)**: tooling, scripts, standards, automation  
- **User experience awareness**: clarity, hierarchy, meaningful product flows  

I primarily work with **TypeScript**, across both frontend systems and backend logic (Node).  
I also build tooling, pipelines, and containerized environments using **Docker**,  
and integrate **LLM-powered automation** into development workflows.

### Currently deepening skills in:
- **Java & backend fundamentals**  
- **Software architecture** (layered, feature-based, domain logic)  
- **Financial software concepts** (robustness, correctness, consistency)  
- **Testing & CI/CD reliability**  
- **Engineering workflows & scalable development practices**

### Long-term goal
To grow into a well-rounded **Software Engineer**, capable of navigating architecture, development, automation, and product-focused thinking — delivering systems that are elegant, stable, and maintainable.
